        <h1>Design Thinking in Barcelona</h1>
            <img src="images/suitcase.png" alt="suitcase prototype" class="image3">
            <b>Overview:</b> This past summer, I was able to take a design thinking course in which we designed a variety of products. The following are overviews of a few of the highlighted projects that I completed in which I got to learn more about user empathy, user interviews, and proto-typing. <br><br>
            
            <h2>Suitcase Product Redesign</h2>

Elena, Alice, Jordan, Joseph, Zoe<br> <br>
            <b>Interviews Highlights:</b>
Removable wheels so it could be repurposed for storage<br>
Organizable compartments for convenience<br>
Weight meter to track luggage weight<br>
Vacuumable compartments to increase storage efficiency <br>
Customizable section/cloth in front of the bag or handle for differentiation <br>
            <br>

            <b>Prototype ideas:</b>
           Collapsible, resizable, vacuum seal, self-weighing, self-cleaning


         <br> <br>
            <b>Major Problems:</b>
No wheels or two wheels so it’s always falling<br>
Heavy, even when empty<br>
The material can be prone to scuffing or bumps due to mistreatment<br>
Hard to recognize bags because they’re all very similar<br>
It gets messy when you want to just take one thing out<br>
Security<br>

            <br>
    
            <b>Bag Ideas:</b>
Vacuum technology<br>
Weight meter <br>
More compartments that are item-specific <br>
Removable wheels so that the suitcase can be repurposed for storage<br>
Optional sizes<br>
Customizable handle/cloth to differentiate<br>
Foldable/compressible bag<br>














            <h2>Bath Mat Product Redesign</h2>

            <b>Overview:</b>
We were given a task to find a daily household item or service and redesign its service based on user feedback. This was a quick project developing user interviewing and user empathy skills developed in my month-long, 3 credit study abroad course. This was a project done by a team of 4 other people.
<br> <br>
            <b>Timeline:</b>
3 days
            <br> <br>

            <b>Contributions:</b>
User research, prototyping<br>
<br>
            
            <b>Goals:</b> 
Create a product that solved the primary issues people found with a daily shower experience.<br><br>

            <b>Sample Interview Questions:</b><br>
Can you describe how you get out of a shower?<br>
Follow up -- what are some struggles you face?<br>
Have you ever slipped while stepping out of the shower?		<br>
Describe your current bath mat.<br>

What do you think the purpose of the bath mat is?<br>
Have you thought of a bath mat with other functionalities such as blow drying mat or heat up mat?<br>
Which would you likely use it? Why?<br>
What could you improve about your current bath mat?<br><br>

            <b>Feedback:</b><br>
Many people struggle with the coldness when getting out of the shower<br>
People dislike having wet floors despite the mat<br>
Functionality and cost matter more than aesthetic<br>
Using different fabrics/materials/shapes<br>
Stick to the ground so it doesn’t move around<br>
Hygiene is an issue<br>
Doesn’t dry quickly/ annoying to clean or dry<br>
            <br>

            <b>Prototypes:</b><br>
From our feedback, we realized that our target audience was not truly interested in a dryer mat. It was not very functional in the quick time that it takes for them to get out of the shower. The excess water left on floors as well as the texture that they personally preferred was more important. With this in mind we pivoted to focusing more on functionality and affordance.<br> <br>
            Our target audience is people with shared bathrooms or those who have their own homes or apartments. Typically being well established, such as individuals who are 30-years-old and older. <br><br>

            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
Our final design is a bath mat with 3 different layers. The first layer will be a removable layer where each customer can customize it to their own features, such as whether the mat is memory foam (for comfort), thin (for simplicity), heats up (for warmth), has essential oils (to prevent bacterial growth), pink, blue, etc. Since the first layer is removable, it also allows it to be washed easily. The second layer is a layer of porous silicon where excess water from the first layer can drain down into the second layer. This allows the first layer to dry quicker since water is not sitting in the first layer. The silicone allows the second layer to be cleaned easily and the water will seep down to the third layer, which is made of flex tape. With the water sitting in the third layer, flex tape will create a watertight seal with the floor, which prevents the mat from slipping and moving after one gets out of the shower.
<br><br>
The second and third layers are permanently attached and it works better because it incorporates the idea of not having one universal product, but also having add ons. This way, the first layer can easily be replaced when it gets moldy, allowing the second and third layers to be kept, cleaned, and reused by the customer while the customer changes the top layer. This also allows different people of the same household to replace the top layer to their preference when they shower.
